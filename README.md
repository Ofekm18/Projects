1. Maze Generation Algorithm
This project involves the development of a sophisticated maze generation algorithm implemented in Java.
 The algorithm uses advanced search techniques such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Prim's Algorithm to create complex and unique maze structures.
 The project is designed to handle various maze configurations, including different grid sizes and complexity levels.
 The implementation includes a user interface that visualizes the maze creation process in real-time, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.
 Additionally, the project includes functionality for solving the generated mazes using algorithms like A* or Breadth-First Search (BFS), providing a comprehensive tool for both generating and solving mazes.

3. Hotel Management System
This project is a comprehensive hotel management system developed in Java, designed to handle various operational aspects of a hotel.
 The system includes modules for booking management, customer information tracking, and billing.
 It leverages serialization for data persistence, ensuring that booking records and customer details are securely stored and easily retrievable.
 The system is built with a modular architecture, allowing easy expansion and integration with additional features like room service management or customer feedback systems.
 The project also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, enabling hotel staff to manage bookings, check-ins, and check-outs efficiently.
